## Development Process
I made this app to test the functionality of github copilot agent mode. 90% of the code I would 
say is written by the agent. It took me a total of 6 hours of non stop work to complete this.
It was interesting not coding. Instead I acted as a technical manager I would say. 
I had the vision & often times the idea on how to implement a feature. The agent would just do
the manual task. Of course it would create implementation I did not mention without me. 
At the end of the day I feel like I have a good understanding on how the app functions and the
behind the scenes. Maybe not the adblock part though...
